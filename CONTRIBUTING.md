# Contributon to Magic

In order to contribute to Magic, we need your employer's consent that you are legally allowed to contribute to open source projects.
This implies at the minimum having your closest upwards _"C level executive"_ send you an email confirming that it's OK for
you to contribute to Magic, allowing us to sub-license your work any ways we see fit, for then to forward that email to thomas@ainiro.io.

Hence, if you want to contribute to Magic, you will need to send two emails to thomas@ainiro.io as explained further up. Otherwise
we cannot for legal reasons accept your contribution.

# An AI-based Low-Code and No-Code Software Development Automation Framework

Magic Cloud is a software development automation platform based upon AI, Low-Code, and No-Code. It's based upon [Hyperlambda](https://docs.ainiro.io/hyperlambda/), allowing you to dynamically create and orchestrate workflows, almost within a _"drag'n'drop development environment"_.

In addition to its workflows, Magic also comes with a CRUD generator, allowing you to point it at your database, click a button, and wrap all your tables into CRUD endpoints. Combined with its workflow capabilities, this can sometimes save you 98% of your time when delivering backend APIs.

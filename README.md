# An AI-based Low-Code and No-Code Software Development Automation Framework

**IMPORTANT** - Magic is _no longer open source_. You can read the arguments [here](https://dev.to/polterguy/no-more-mr-open-source-guy-95k). We will keep this repository as is, but it should be considered _"legacy"_ and will no longer receive any updates, fixes, or changes. All work is currently committed to a closed source fork of this repository, which inevitably over time will rapidly make this repository insecure and obsolete for obvious reasons.

Magic Cloud is a software development automation platform created and maintained by [AINIRO.IO](https://ainiro.io) based upon AI, Low-Code, and No-Code. It's based upon [Hyperlambda](https://docs.ainiro.io/hyperlambda/), allowing you to dynamically create and orchestrate workflows, almost within a _"drag'n'drop development environment"_.

In addition to its workflows, Magic also comes with a CRUD generator, allowing you to point it at your database, click a button, and wrap all your tables into CRUD endpoints. Combined with its workflow capabilities, this can sometimes save you 90% of your time when delivering backend APIs. Magic is built on top of .Net 8 and Angular.

Magic comes with Docker containers and is easy to install, but [AINIRO.IO also hosts Magic](https://ainiro.io) for a fee.

## Modules

Magic was created to make it very easy to create small and medium sized backend APIs, and contains components for all problems related to backend development. For more information about Magic, please refer to its documentation below.

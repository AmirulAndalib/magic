# Where the Machine Creates the Code!

Magic Cloud is a software development automation platform created and maintained by [AINIRO.IO](https://ainiro.io) based upon AI, Low-Code, and No-Code. It's based upon [Hyperlambda](https://docs.ainiro.io/hyperlambda/), allowing you to dynamically create and orchestrate code, using meta programming an generative AI.

In addition to its generative AI capabilities, Magic also comes with a CRUD generator, allowing you to point it at your database, click a button, and wrap all your tables into CRUD endpoints. Combined with its AI capabilities, this can sometimes save you 90% of your time when delivering backend APIs. Magic is built on top of .Net 9 and Angular.

## No-Code AI

Magic contains its own LLM that allows for generating Hyperlambda (backend) code using natural language. Combined with meta programming, this almost entirely eliminates the need to understand code and software development, yet still making it possible to create fairly complex systems using _"vibe coding"_, such as for instance [AI agents](https://ainiro.io/ai-agents) with function calling, and custom ChatGPT _"clones"_ using the [AI Expert System](https://ainiro.io/ai-expert-system).

The concept is you provide a comment and description for what your Hyperlambda file should do. Then you click generate, and the LLM will automatically create code encapsulating your use case.

## Modules

Magic was created to make it easy to create small and medium sized backend APIs, and contains components for all problems related to backend development. For more information about Magic, please refer to its documentation below.
